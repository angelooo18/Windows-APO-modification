So here's something I'm sure people in this thread would find interesting: I found a way to completely remove CAudioLimiter from the audio path!

What I realized is that CAudioLimiter is an APO like any other, and like all APOs, it has its own registered COM class with its own CLSID. This blog post has the CLSID - it's {D69E0717-DD4B-4B25-997A-DA813833B8AC}. We can deliberately mess up that class registration so that the Windows audio engine cannot find it anymore. Luckily, if the Windows audio engine can't load that APO, then audio still works - it just bypasses the missing APO!

Here's the procedure:

In the Registry Editor, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{D69E0717-DD4B-4B25-997A-DA813833B8AC}.
You're gonna have to mess with the permissions to be able to make the required changes. Change the owner of the InProcServer32 subkey to Administrators, then give Administrators Full control.
Make any change that would prevent the class from being loaded. For example, change the (default) value to add a "DISABLED" prefix so that the path to audioeng.dll is broken.
Restart the Windows Audio service (audiosrv).

After I did this, audio still worked fine but I was unable to trigger the limiter - the audio pipeline goes all the way up to 0.00 dBFS without any additional distortion. I think it should be truly bit-perfect now (in 24-bit at least - in 16-bit there is still dithering), but I haven't confirmed it.

Just signed up here in order to alert you of an issue/consequence of this workaround: audio capturing software and features stop working. At least in Windows 11 24H2 (haven't tested other releases), Discord screen share stopped including audio, and OBS Studio's “Window capture” and “Application audio capture” stopped working (in OBS, logs show a failure regarding WASAPI's VIRTUAL_AUDIO_DEVICE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK). The apoenum tool will also throw an error before listing all available APOs too, because of the broken path.

Other resources say CAudioLimiter can be disabled by the following registry edit:
In HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AudioEngine\AudioProcessingObjects\{D69E0717-DD4B-4B25-997A-DA813833B8AC}, replace the value of APOInterface0 with {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}.
I haven't properly tested if this actually works (i.e., if it effectively removes CAudioLimiter), but at least audio capturing still works afterwards.
